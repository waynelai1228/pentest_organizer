1. create a class for storing vulnerabilities.
   - the class would contain: vulnerability name, description, resources, category (web, cryptography, embedded, etc).
2. test plan contains vulnerabilites.
   - the class would contain: list of vulnerabilites, progress, notes.
3. first stage would be to prompt the user to select the vulnerabilities that they think would appear in the application being tested.
4. then a test plan would be created based on what the user selected.
5. user can track the progress by marking the vulnerabilities as "not started", "in progress", or "done checking".
6. user should be able to add notes to the test plan.
